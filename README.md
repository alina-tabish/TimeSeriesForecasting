# Time Series Forecasting with Machine Learning Model ARIMA

Time series forecasting is a data science task that is critical to a variety of activities within any business organisation. Time series forecasting is a useful tool that can help to understand how historical data influences the future. This is done by looking at past data, defining the patterns, and producing short or long-term predictions.

The aim of this project was get familiar with timeseries and forecasting ML models and predict the future values.

The dataset was download from Kaggle: [Forecasts for Product Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting). The goal of using this dataset is to explore the data of the product and their demand and predict the future number of demands so that people some actions could be taken regarding it.

The dataset contains _historical product demand for a manufacturing company with footprints globally_. The company provides thousands of products within dozens of product categories. There are four central warehouses to ship products within the region it is responsible for. Since the products are manufactured in different locations all over the world, it normally takes more than one month to ship products via ocean to different central warehouses. If forecasts for each product in different central with reasonable accuracy for the monthly demand for month after next can be achieved, it would be beneficial to the company in multiple ways.
